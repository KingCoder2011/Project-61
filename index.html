        <p>A book is a medium of spreading knowledge. They are also the best medium of studies. As some books are just for entertainment, some are to learn, some should be applied in our lives. The motives of different books are different. Francis Bacon has very well described books in his essay ‘Of Studies’. He said -<br>

            “Histories make men wise; poets witty; the mathematics subtle; natural philosophy deep; moral grave; logic and rhetoric able to contend”.<br>

            We should read all types of books but apply only what we need. This is because we are taught various subjects in our schools.<br>

            Printing with the help of blocks was first seen in China in 220 AD. Whereas it was 1040 AD when printing became possible with the help of technology. After the development of printing technology, it became easy to print books. Nowadays books are also available online in the form of e-books.<br>

            Some people feel tough to carry books; they can easily read e-books on their phones. Books contain good thoughts and knowledge. The more you read them the wiser you grow. Make books your best friend and they will never disappoint you.
